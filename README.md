# Interior-Point algorithm
This is implementation of Interior-Point algorithm to solve LPP problems.

Project is made to learn Interior-Point algorithm

## Description

### The input contains:

- A vector of coefficients of objective function - C.
- A matrix of coefficients of constraint function - A.
- A vector of right-hand side numbers - b.
- The approximation accuracy.

### The output contains:

- The string ”The method is not applicable!”

  or

- A vector of decision variables - x*
- Maximum (minimum) value of the objective function.
